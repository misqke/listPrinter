HOW TO USE 

1. Double click the 'index.html' file to open it in your default browser.

   in the categories alphabetically. If you leave these unselected the lists will be printed in 
   the order they are typed in the file.

3. Click 'Choose File' and select the .txt file containing your list(s).

4. When the print dialog opens you can print the list or choose to save it as a pdf. 

Printing Notes: 

  * Styling is set to work with standard 8.5" x 11" printer paper.

  * Make sure Layout is set to 'Portrait'.

  * Margins are already applied and can be sets to 'None' in print options.

CREATING YOUR LIST FILE


A .txt list can be created in Notepad or Microsoft Word. Simply type out your list in a single line,
seperating each item with a comma (,). The first item in the line should be the category of the list.
To start a new category simply start typing on a new line. You can leave empty lines in between the 
categories to make it simpiler to read if you'd like.

List Notes:

  * If creating a file in Microsoft Word, be sure to save the file as 'Plain Text (*.txt)'.

  * The application will automatically capitalize the first letter of each word.

  * You can NOT use commas (,) in the items of the list.

  * Any commas added at the end of a list will result in a blank line for write in items.

    Example: dairy, milk, eggs, butter,,,

    The above example will create a category called 'Dairy' with with milk, eggs, butter, and 3 blank
    lines at the end.
